# AngularSurvey

Create a survey by adding an unlimited number of questions one after the other.
Once I’m done adding questions, I can take the survey, going through and answering all the questions one at a time. Validation must work for each question to ensure that I select an option where appropriate and do not leave the text input field empty
When I’ve answered the last question, The survey engine should display all the questions along with my responses for each one
